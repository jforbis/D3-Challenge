## Background

This project uses 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/),which includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, and various other metrics, by state. Using this data I created a scatter plot between two of the data variables, 'poverty' and 'smokers', and their correlation to healthcare. My scatter plot was created with D3 techniques and it used circles that represented each state and its corresponding data.
