## Background

This project uses 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/),which includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, and various other metrics, by state. Using this data I created a scatter plot between two of the data variables, 'poverty' and 'smokers', and their correlation to healthcare. My scatter plot was created with D3 techniques and it used circles that represented each state and its corresponding data. 

Not only was this project useful in nature but it was also a bit creative as the chart itself is interactable. The user can choose one of two different x-axis options to gleen whichever information they are looking for. Each data set associated with the x-axis is being compared to that specific states percentage of having healthcare.
